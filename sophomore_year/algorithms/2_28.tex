\section{Graph searching} 
Consider a graph $G=(E,V)$, where $E$ is a set of pairs of elements of $V$. Then $E \leq {V \choose 2} $ if $G$ is directed, and $E \leq  V(V-1)$ if $G$ is directed. Adjacency matrix, adjacency list (how to store). linked list. list comparing complexities. hash table. binary search tree. help i didn't take data structures. i also cannot read the board.

look at the complexity list in the textbook.

Reachability: given $G=(V,E)$ with source $s$, the goal is to find all the vertices $u$ reachable from $s$.

Let visited equal $\{\} $. Depth first search:
\begin{verbatim}
def DFS(v)
    if v in visited return
    visited.add(v)
    for w in v.adj:
        DFS(w) 
\end{verbatim}
Now we do Breadth first search (BFS). It visits vertices in order of distance from $s$. prinn's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
