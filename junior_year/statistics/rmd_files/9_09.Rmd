Some variable can be ordered and some can't. An example is majors in college, which are completely unordered (the "mean" of a major makes no sense). For categorical variables, there will be a disjoint and exhaustive number of categories (you can use the "other" category to make this exhaustive). Because what we studied is categorical, there is no meaning to mean/median/etc. However pie charts do make sense (example: pie chart of pies).

Pie charts only work with **non-overlapping** categories. Please do not do that. You can download form responses as `.csv` files. From here we can open these in Excel or your form processor of choice. Put everything (`R`-scripts, data sets, etc) in the same directory. Import the data into `R`-studio.

A data frame is just a speical matrix. Every column corresponds to an observed value, which can be a quantity or a category. Think of data frames as events, subsets of the whole population. We want to create an `R` script that communicates easily with our data set. We will create something called a "working directory" in our console, with the command `setwd` (use quotations around). tables, data frames (problem 3project 4)
