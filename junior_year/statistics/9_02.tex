\section{Simulations of random variables} 
True randomness is difficult, computers use different ways to ``simulate'' randomness enough to pass statistical randomness tests. We can use RNG that comes from physical phenomena (cursor movements, typing, entropy on linux). This stuff is not relevant to the class but one can read more on the links on the website.

\subsection{Discrete uniform}
Let $X$ be a random variable, where \[
x \sim 
\begin{cases}
    x_1 & \text{with probability } \frac{1}{n}\\
    x_2& \text{with probability } \frac{1}{n}\\
    \vdots& \text{with probability } \frac{1}{n}\\
    x_n & \text{with probability } \frac{1}{n}.

\end{cases}
