\section{More R stuff} 
You can use the terminal/console or a script to interact with R. You can also run R snippets within rmd files. Another way to interact is through RStudio. R can be used as a glorified calculator (how I use it).

See \texttt{testing.Rmd} for use cases and basic syntax. Define variables with arrow and you can see them in the ``environment'' area in RStudio.
