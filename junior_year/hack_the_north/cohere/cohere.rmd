LLMs? Relationship between images and text. Things to do: classify, search, summzarize, geneatate, clister , extract, rewrite.

- Text generation: `co.generate` takes text and makes more. make sure to generate multiple outputs. Example: "In summary", then complete the conclusion. `https://os.cohere.ai/playground/xlarge/generate`
- Text representation. Creates a numerical representation of text to manipulate somehow. Embeddings are useful since you can build classifiers with them. Use `co.classify`. Other way around as well: `https://pokaidex.art/`. Type of pokemon and description is created by Cohere generate. Use streamit app. Another one is date generator (LMAOOO pulp fiction). `https://urzas.ai/`. These apps get REALLY popular.

Read the docs. Chaining/piping makes things powerful. More difficult tasks can only be performed when broken down into subtasks.

Ai generated math??
