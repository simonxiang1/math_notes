\section{Lie groupoids and differentiable stacks} 
An overview: this minicourse will define Lie groupoids, and give examples and morphisms of special classes of Lie groupoids. Then we talk about an equivalence relation between Lie groupoids, and some geometric structures on Lie groupoids. The second part of course focuses on stacks and differentiable stacks, and some geometric structures on differentiable stacks.

\begin{definition}[]
    A Lie groupoid $G_1 \rightrightarrows G_0$ consists of smooth maps $s \colon G_1 \to G_0$, $t \colon G_1 \to G_0$, $m \colon G_1 \times _{G_0} G_1\to G_1$, $i \colon G_1 \to G_1$, $e \colon G_0 \to G_0$. More compactly, it is a groupoid where the sets $G_1$ of objects and $G_0$ are manifolds and the maps are smooth.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Smooth manifolds $M$ give a Lie groupoid $M \rightrightarrows M$, and $G \rightrightarrows *$ is simply a Lie group. There is also a Lie group action on the manifold  $M \times G \to M$, resulting in a Lie groupoid $M \times G \rightrightarrows M$. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    Another example is the principal $G$-bundle over a manifold. Let $G$ be a Lie group, $M$ be a smooth manifold, $P \to M$ be a principal $G$-bundle. Then we have the Gauge groupoid $[ (P \times P) / G \rightrightarrows M]$. We also have a vector bundle over a manifold $E \to M$, where the Lie groupoid structure is given by $[\mathrm{GL}(E) \rightrightarrows M]$. Finally, we have the tangent groupoid associated to a Lie groupoid, where $[G \rightrightarrows M] \leadsto [TG \rightrightarrows TM]$.
\end{example}
