\subsection{Instantons}
\begin{definition}[]
    Let $X$ be a 4-manifold equipped with a conformal structure. A \textbf{Yangs-Mills instanton}, or \emph{anti-self-dual connection}, in the hermitian vector bundle $E \to X$, is a unitary connection $\nabla \in \mathcal A_E$ such that \[
        \left( F _{\nabla} \right) ^+ = 0. 
    \] Here $\left( \cdot  \right) ^+$ is the self-dual projection $\frac{1}{2}\left( 1+* \right) $, mapping $\Omega^2(\mathfrak u(E))$ to $\Omega^+_g(\mathfrak u(E))$.
\end{definition}
For a gauge transformation $u \in \mathcal G_E$, one has \[
    \left( u^* F_{\nabla} \right) ^+ = (u F_{\nabla}u^{-1})^+ = uF^+ _{\nabla}u^{-1}
\] so $\mathcal G_E$ preserves the instantons. Thus the instanton equation, like the flatness equation, posseses gauge symmetry. The equation $\left( F_{\nabla+A} \right) ^+ = 0$ amounts to a first order differential equation for $A$. Donaldson theory is the study of this equation; the focus is largely on the case of rank 2 vector bundles. Our purpose here is to understand a much simpler case, that of instantons in line bundles $L \to X$.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $(X,g)$ be a closed, oriented Riemannian 4-manifold, and $L \to X$ a hermitian line bundle. Then $L$ admits an instanton iff $c_1(L)$ lies in the group $\mathcal H^- _{[g]}\cap  H^2_{\Z}$. If $b^+ \left(X \right) >0$ then, for a generic conformal structure $[g]$, no non-trivial line bundle admits instantons.
