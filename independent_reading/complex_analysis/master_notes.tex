\title{Complex Analysis Notes}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
These are some notes I took to complement my complex analysis course freshman year, since I was generally unhappy with our (very applied) textbook. Some also miscellaneous topics I choose to study about in complex analysis might go here. If you have questions, comments, corrections, etc, feel free to email them to me at \url{simonxiang@utexas.edu}.
