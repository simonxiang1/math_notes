\epigraph{$\quad$\emph{A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of eath or hard marl, resisting penetration ... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it ... yet finally it surrounds the resistant substance.}}{\emph{â€”\,Alexander Grothendieck}}
