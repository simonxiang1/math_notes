Notes following \emph{A Term of Commutative Algebra}, by Altman and Kleiman. This book is intended to be a modern improvement on the classic text by Atiyah and Macdonald. These notes were taken in preparation for my algebraic geometry course next semester. Source files: \url{https://git.simonxiang.xyz/math_notes/files.html}
