\maketitle
The name of ``\emph{Algebraic Geometry}'' has always been alluring to me, dangling like bait on a fish hook, a mountain of prerequisites and problems awaiting on the surface above. There are notes for independent reading in Algebraic Geometry, following \emph{The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry} by Ravi Vakil. The reason I follow this book as opposed to a classical literature like Hartshorne is simply because it's funnierâ€” usually humorous or entertaining works tend to be more readable (counterexample: Hatcher).
