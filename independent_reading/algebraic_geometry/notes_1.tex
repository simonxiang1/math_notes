\epigraph{$\quad$\emph{A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of eath or hard marl, resisting penetration ... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it ... yet finally it surrounds the resistant substance.}}{\emph{—\,Alexander Grothendieck}}

Before we start, here are a handful of entertaining quotes from the introduction.
\begin{quotation}
    \emph{``Algebraic geometry `seems to have acquired the reputation of being esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly plotting to wake over all the rest of mathematics!' ''}

    \emph{``Do not be seduced by the lotus eaters into infatuation with untethered abstraction.''}

    \emph{``This I promise: if I use the word `topoi', you can shoot me.}

    \emph{``Finally, if you attempt to read this without working through a significant number of exercises, I will come to your house and pummel you with \emph{\'El\'ements de G\'eom\'etrie Alg\'ebrique} until you beg for mercy.''}

    —\,Albert Einsten
