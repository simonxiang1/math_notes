\maketitle
I'm excited to say that I'm participating in the Directed Reading Program (DRP) this semester, mentored by Arun Debray! (Read more here: \url{web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp}). This semester, I'm following a book called \emph{From Calculus to Cohomology: De Rham cohomology and characteristics classes} by Madsen and Tornehave. 

These are the full version of the notes, taken to help me learn the material. I plan on summarizing my results in a sort of exposition style to put on the DRP website, as well as a beamer presentation for the symposium. I plan on having all three files hosted on my website somewhere, probably around here: \url{https://git.simonxiang.xyz/math_notes/files.html}
