\title{Complex Analysis Lecture Notes}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
These are my lecture notes for the Fall 2020 section of Complex Analysis (Math 361) at UT Austin with Dr.\ Radin. These were taken live in class, usually only formatting or typo related things were corrected after class. You can view the source code here: \url{https://git.simonxiang.xyz/math_notes/file/freshman_year/complex_analysis/master_notes.tex.html}.
I was also unhappy with the textbook, so some supplementary notes from different texts are found at the bottom of the document.
