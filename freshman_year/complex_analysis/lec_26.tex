Wow, it's December already. Yada yada integration stuff.
\subsection{Meromorphic functions}
\begin{definition}[Meromorphic functions]
A function $f$ is said to be \textbf{meromorphic} in a domain $D$ if it is analytic in $D$ except for poles.
\end{definition}
Missed something about the argument principle.
\begin{namedthm}{Rouch\'es Theorem}
    Let $f$ and $g$ be analytic inside and on a simple closed curve $\Gamma $ with $|f(z)|>|g(z)|$ on $\Gamma $. Then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeroes in $\Gamma $ counting multiplicity.
\end{namedthm}
\begin{example}
    Let $f(z)=-4z^3$, $g(z)=z^7+z-1$. So $(f+g)(z)=z^7-4z^3+z-1$. Let $\Gamma=S^1  $. Note that $|g(z)|\leq 3$ and $|f(z)|=4$ on $\Gamma $, so the hypothesis holds.
\end{example}
\subsection{Conformal maps}
Wasn't really in the mood for taking notes.
