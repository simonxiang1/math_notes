\section{October 1, 2020}
Last time: we had a test. Today we'll talk about branches and next time move onto integration, finally. So I had a test until 11 today, and I probably won't take many (any) notes because I'm doing my homework (due at 2) during the lecture. (If anybody wants to send me notes, please do, my email is \url{simonxiang@utexas.edu}).
