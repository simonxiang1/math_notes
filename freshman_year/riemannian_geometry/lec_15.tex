\subsection{Calculus of variations}
Suppose we have $z(t)$, where $z(0)=0,z(2)=0$. We want to minimize the integral $\mathcal{L} =\int_0^2 \frac{1}{2}\dot z^2-32z \, dt$. We will do this two ways: one is the ``sloppy'' version with our usual notation for the calculus of variations, and one by a mathematically precise method. The usual notation has a precise meaning behind it, but it just seems sloppy.
