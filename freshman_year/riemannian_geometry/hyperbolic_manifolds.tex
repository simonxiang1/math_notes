\begin{document}
\maketitle
A reading project for the Spring 2021 graduate section of Riemannian Geometry (Math 392C) at UT Austin, taught by Dr.\ Sadun. 
Here, a ``typical reader'' is someone that has just finished this course and knows the basics of covering space theory.
This writeup gives a brief overview of various topics in hyperbolic geometry, concluding with the definition of Teichm\"uller space. Source files: \url{https://git.simonxiang.xyz/math_notes/files.html}
