In two dimensions, parallel transport around an orientation preserving loop is a rotation, which you can parametrize by just a number $\theta$. You can sum up the rotations around tiny little loops. Define $K$ to be the rotation per unit block on an area $A$ bounded by a loop $\gamma $, then define the size of rotation by $P_{\gamma }=\iint_A K\, d$Area.
