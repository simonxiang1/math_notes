\maketitle
Lecture notes for the Fall 2020 graduate section of Abstract Algebra (Math 380C) at UT Austin, taught by Dr.\ Ciperiani. I'm currently auditing this course due to the fact that I'm not officially enrolled in it. These notes were taken live in class (and so they may contain many errors). You can view the source code here: \url{https://git.simonxiang.xyz/math_notes/file/freshman_year/abstract_algebra/master_notes.tex.html}.
