\subsection{Something happened here...}
Today: we're finishing what we should have finished last week. I don't really know what's going on... should have payed more attention during the Sylow unit. We have seen that $n_p=1$ or $n_q=1$ for $P$ or $Q$ normal in $G$. Furthermore, $P\cap Q=\{1_G\} $ since $|P|$ and $|Q|$ are coprime. This implies that $PQ$ has order $|P|\cdot |Q|=|G|$, and these imply that $G=PQ$. Together, we have that $G$ is a semidirect product of $P$ and $Q$ (depending on which one is normal).
\begin{example}
    If $|G|=2^2\cdot 3$ for $G$ a group, let $p=2$ and $q=3$. Then $P$ is a $2$-Sylow implies $P$ is isomorphic to $\Z /4\Z$ or $\Z /2\Z\times \Z /2\Z$. Similarly, $Q$ a $3$-Sylow implies $Q \cong \Z /3\Z$. We know that $n_2=1$ or $3$, $n_3=1$ or $4$, and $n_2=1$ or $n_3=1$. Then $n_2=n_3=1\implies P,Q\trianglelefteq G$, $P\cap Q=1,\,PQ=G$. Together these imply that $G\cong P\times Q$. I'm not entirely sure what happened here either...
\end{example}
