\maketitle
Homework for the Fall 2020 graduate section of Abstract Algebra (Math 380C) at UT Austin, taught by Dr.\ Ciperiani. I'm currently auditing this course due to the fact that I'm not officially enrolled in it (ergo the homework is semi-optional). The course follows Dummit and Foote (Third Edition). You can view the source code here: \url{https://git.simonxiang.xyz/math_notes/file/freshman_year/abstract_algebra/master_homework.tex.html}.
