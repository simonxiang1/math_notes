\title{Algebraic Topology Miscellaneous Notes}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
Miscellaneous notes for the Fall 2020 graduate section of Algebraic Topology (Math 382C) at UT Austin, taught by Dr.\ Allcock. The course was loaded with pictures and fancy diagrams, so I didn't \TeX{} any notes for the lectures themselves. However, I did take some miscellaneous supplementary notes, here they are.
