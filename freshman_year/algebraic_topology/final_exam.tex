\maketitle
This is my final exam for the Fall 2020 section of Algebraic Topology (Math 382C) at UT Austin with Dr.\ Allcock. A note on notation: I try to use \texttt{\textbackslash cong} ($\cong$) for group isomorphisms and \texttt{\textbackslash simeq} ($\simeq$) for homotopy equivalences. Sometimes I mess up and both $\simeq$ and $\approx$ are used for isomorphisms, sorry if I do, which one should be clear by context. Also, sorry if I talked too muchâ€” I wanted to show as much detail as I possibly could, including side thoughts and approaches, since this exam was presumably meant as an opportunity for me to show what I know. Thank you for a great semester Dr.\ Allcock, I've truly learned a lot! Source files: \url{https://git.simonxiang.xyz/math_notes/files.html}
