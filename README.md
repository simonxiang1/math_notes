# Math Notes
These are a collection of (sometimes incomplete) notes I live-TeXed during my undergrad at UT Austin.

## Reading Projects
- [Langevin MCMC (slides)](independent_reading/langevin_MCMC_drp/drp_slides.pdf) Mentored by [Bobby Shi](https://rhshi.github.io/) in Summer 2023. 
- [Topological Quantum Field Theory](independent_reading/tqft_drp/master_notes.pdf) Mentored by [Will Stewart](https://www.sfb1624.uni-hamburg.de/people/associated-researchers/stewart.html) in Spring 2022. [Talk slides](independent_reading/tqft_drp/slides/drp_slides.pdf))
- [Category Theory (slides)](independent_reading/yoneda_drp/drp_slides.pdf) Mentored by [Rok Gregorik](https://sites.google.com/view/rokgregoric/home) in Fall 2021.
- [De Rham Cohomology](independent_reading/cohomology_drp/master_notes.pdf): Mentored by [Arun Debray](https://adebray.github.io/) in Spring 2020. [Talk slides](independent_reading/cohomology_drp/drp_slides.pdf))

## Junior
- [4-manifolds](junior_year/4_manifolds/master_notes.pdf)

At this point I switched to obsidian for note taking. No plan to publish those notes as of now.

## File organization and structure
In the `sophomore_year` directory, I organize all the `.tex` and `.pdf` files in subdirectories for each class, called `class_name` (e.g. `algebraic_geometry`). The documents are modular, so the file `master_notes.pdf` will contain each compiled `lec_1.tex`, `lec_2.tex`, etc. Currently, the TeX files share a common preamble, located in `sophomore_year/preamble.tex`. 

## TLDR
Go a couple folders down and look for a PDF file called `master_*(something)*.pdf` for the notes for each class.
