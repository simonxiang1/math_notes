# Math Notes
These are a collection of notes I have taken (not too many as of now) at UT Austin. Currently, I'm taking Algebraic Topology, Complex Analysis, and Differential Equations (added Graduate Abstract Algebra on a whim), and plan on TeXing all my notes for these classes and uploading them here. Also: the UT Math Club invites speakers to give talks weekly, so sometimes I type up notes for those too.

## File organization and structure
In the freshman_year directory, I organize all the .tex and .pdf files in subdirectories for each class, called `class_name` (e.g. `algebraic_topology`). The documents are modular, so the file `master_notes.pdf` will contain each compiled `lec_1.tex`, `lec_2.tex`, etc. Currently, the TeX files share a common preamble, located in `freshman_year/preamble.tex`. 

## TLDR
Go a couple folders down and look for a PDF file called `master_*(something)*.pdf` for the notes for each class.
