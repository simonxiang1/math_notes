# Math Notes
These are a collection of notes I have live-TeX'd for my classes at UT Austin. Currently, I'm taking

  - [Algebraic Topology](https://simonxiang.xyz/math/algebraic_topology_notes.pdf) (notes unfinished)
  - [Complex Analysis](https://simonxiang.xyz/math/complex_analysis_notes.pdf)
  - [Differential Equations](https://simonxiang.xyz/math/differential_equations_notes.pdf)
  - [Abstract Algebra](https://simonxiang.xyz/math/abstract_algebra_notes.pdf) 
  
I live TeX notes for complex analysis and abstract algebra, while the algebraic topology notes are taken outside of class. The differential equations repository is only updated before tests, and I miss a lot of abstract algebra lectures. You can click the links above to get to the PDF files for the notes. Also: the UT Math Club invites speakers to give talks weekly, so sometimes I type up [notes](https://simonxiang.xyz/math/math_club_notes.pdf) for those too.

## File organization and structure
In the `freshman_year` directory, I organize all the `.tex` and `.pdf` files in subdirectories for each class, called `class_name` (e.g. `algebraic_topology`). The documents are modular, so the file `master_notes.pdf` will contain each compiled `lec_1.tex`, `lec_2.tex`, etc. Currently, the TeX files share a common preamble, located in `freshman_year/preamble.tex`. 

## TLDR
Go a couple folders down and look for a PDF file called `master_*(something)*.pdf` for the notes for each class.
