# Math Notes
These are a collection of notes I have taken (not too many as of now) at UT Austin. Currently, I'm taking Algebraic Topology, Complex Analysis, and Differential Equations, and plan on TeXing all my homework/notes for these classes and uploading them here.

## File organization and structure
In the freshman_year directory, I organize all the .tex and .pdf files in subdirectories for each class, called `class_name` (e.g. algebraic_topology). The documents are modular, so the file `master_homework.pdf` or `master_notes.pdf` will contain each compiled `hw_0.tex`, `lec_2.tex`, etc. Currently, the TeX files share a common preamble, located in `freshman_year/preamble.tex`.

## TLDR
Go a couple folders down and look for a PDF file called `master_*(something)*.pdf` for the notes/homework for each class.
